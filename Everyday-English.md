`Mar 20` Liferay is not about waiting for the storm to pass. It's about learning to dance in the rain.    
 
 生活不是等待暴风雨的过去，而是要学会在雨中跳舞。

`Mar 21` What is insistence? That is, day after day, you tell yourself to go on for another day.

什么是坚持？就是一天，又一天，你告诉自己，再坚持一天。

`Mar 22` It takes courage to follow your mind. But it takes everything to follow your heart.

跟着理智走，要有勇气；跟着感觉走，要有倾其所有的决心。

`Mar 23` A woman, especially, if she has the misfortune of knowing anything, should conceal it as well as she can. - Jane Austen
一个女人要是什么都懂，那就必须同时懂得怎么伪装成什么都不懂。 - 简.奥斯汀
